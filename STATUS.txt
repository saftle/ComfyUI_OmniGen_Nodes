Working.
- The cup change to coke and earrings removal is done well in 5 steps @ 1024x1024
- Use separate_cfg_infer = True and dtype int8 for mid VRAM
- Entering inference with 5826 MiB allocated, leaving with 5975 MiB
- Peak: 5808 to 6063 MiB Might be more than 8 GiB, not sure
- First run 100 s
- Second 76 s @ 14 s/it

- Use separate_cfg_infer = False and dtype int8 for mid VRAM
- Entering inference with 5962 MiB allocated, leaving with 5975 MiB
- Peak: 6010 MiB Might be more than 8 GiB, not sure
- Second 85 s @ 16 s/it

- Using 2 conditioners you get 2 images, they have some correlation


Best options for RTX3060:
separate_cfg_infer = True
- Less memory and faster

use_kv_cache = False
- Faster, because even when each iteration is slower you need much less iterarions
